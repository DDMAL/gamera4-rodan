==============================
Building and installing Gamera
==============================

Linux (and other \*nix)
=======================

Prerequisites
-------------

- Python 3.5 and later are supported, though Python 3.7 is
  recommended.

  You will need to have the headers (but not the complete source) to
  build Gamera from source code.  Most Linux distributions include
  these as a separate package (eg. ``python-dev`` or ``python-devel``).

- wxPython 4.0.x or later

- ``gcc`` version 3.1 or later.

- libtiff 3.5.x or later

- libpng 1.2.x or later

If any of these prerequisites is installed in a non standard directory,
you can use the environment variables ``CFLAGS`` and ``LDFLAGS`` to
pass its locations to the build script, e.g.::

  CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
  LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
  export CFLAGS LDFLAGS


Standard Build and Install
--------------------------

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.  Open a
terminal and type::

  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install

By default, parallelization of the genetic algorithms is only compiled
into Gamera under Linux and with gcc version > 4.2, because we could only
get it running in this environment. If you are sure that you have unbroken
OpenMP support on your system, you can compile Gamera with::

  python setup.py build --openmp=yes

If Gamera is compiled with OpenMP on your system, but OpenMP does not work
on your system for some reason, you can switch it off with::

  python setup.py build --openmp=no


Installing without root privileges
----------------------------------

.. _without_root:

If you do not have root access to your machine, you can make a local
installation of Gamera.

A quick-and-easy way to do this is to use the ``virtual_python.py``
script available here__, and then follow the standard installation
instructions (without using sudo)::

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install

.. __: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#creating-a-virtual-python

Alternatively, you can set up a local installation by hand.

Make a local python module directory somewhere that you have write
privileges (such as your home directory)::

  mkdir ~/python

From the Gamera build directory, install Gamera into that directory::

  python setup.py install --home=~/python

Set up an environment variables so Python can find stuff there (you
may want to add this to your ~/.bash_profile file)::

  export PYTHONPATH=~/python/lib/python

Add the local Python scripts directory to your path::

  export PATH=~/python/bin:$PATH

Now you should be able to run the ``gamera_gui`` script from the
command line.

Running
-------

Run the ``gamera_gui`` script, which should have installed to
``/usr/local/bin``.  This file can also be copied anywhere (such as
the Desktop) and double-clicked to run Gamera.

.. note:: Running the script from the root of the source tree will not
  work, since it will not be able to find the compiled version of Gamera.

Installing without wxPython
---------------------------

When you need Gamera as a backend for document processing routines on
a server and do not need the GUI, it can save a lot of trouble to
avoid the installation of wxPython. For this case, use the option
``--nowx`` for ``setup.py``::

  python setup.py --nowx build
  sudo python setup.py --nowx install


Mac OS-X
========

Earlier versions of Gamera ran on OS-X by using X11 as an emulation of
a standard Unix environment.  The current SVN version of Gamera now
uses Cocoa, and feels much more like a standard Macintosh
application.  Please follow the instructions for *either* X11 or Cocoa
install below.


Native (Cocoa) build
--------------------

Prerequisites
`````````````

Gamera installs out of the box on Mac OS-X 10.4 (Tiger) and 10.5 (Leopard).
The only prerequisite is to install XCode, which is shipped with the
OS-X installation DVD, but is not installed by default.

It should be noted that OS-X 10.4 comes with the unstable branch 2.5 of
wxPython. So far we have not yet encountered any problems with this
version, but if you have any problems, please consider to install
wxPython 2.6 instead. This is *not* possible from the binary
installers from http://www.wxpython.org/, because there is none for
Python 2.3, and the other Python versions require a particular prerelease
of Xcode to build extensions, that is no longer available.
So if you decide to upgrade wxPython on OS-X 10.4, you must do it from
the source release of wxPython 2.6.

Standard Build and Install
``````````````````````````

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.

To build Gamera, open a terminal and type::

  python setup.py build

and then to install (you'll need to have admin privileges)::

  sudo pythonw setup.py install

On OS-X 10.4, you must do the installation with ``pythonw`` rather than
with ``python``, because ``gamera_gui`` is a GUI application. On OS-X 10.5
this distinction is no longer necessary, but using ``pythonw`` also works.

On OS-X 10.5, the script ``gamera_gui`` is installed to ``/usr/local/bin``,
which is also in the default search PATH for programs.
Prior to OS-X 10.5, the script ``gamera_gui`` was installed to
``/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.?/bin``, which
is not in the default search PATH. You can either add this directory
to your search PATH, or install the scripts to ``/usr/bin`` with::

  sudo pythonw setup.py install_scripts -d /usr/bin

.. note::
  In its default configuration, the Python distutils on MacOS X
  build fat binaries. You can speedup the compilation time
  by a factor two by removing the unnecessary architecture from
  your distutils build settings.

  The critical part are the architecture options "-arch ppc" and
  "-arch i386". When you do not want to redistribute the compiled
  binaries, you can simply remove one of the architectures.
  Depending on the OSX/Python version, this is done in
  ``/Library/Framework/Python.framework/Versions/2.?/lib/python2.?/config/Makefile``,
  or in
  ``/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/distutils/sysconfig.py``


Installing without root privileges
``````````````````````````````````

The instructions for `installing without root (administrator)
privileges`__ can also be used on Mac OS-X.

__ without_root_

Running
```````

Start the Terminal application and run the ``gamera_gui`` script.

.. note:: Running the script from the root of the source tree will not
  work, since it will not be able to find the compiled version of
  Gamera.


X11 build
---------

Please note that this build is no longer maintained by the Gamera developers.
So use it only when the Cocoa build is not possible for some reason (e.g. on a
legacy OS-X 10.3 system).

Prerequisites
`````````````

- Mac OS-X 10.3 (Panther) or presumably later

- Python 3.5 (including the version included).

- wxPython-GTK 4.0.x or later

  Since there is no official build of the Gtk+/X11 version for Mac
  OS-X, I have made one available in the Gamera SourceForge Files
  section.

- XCode.  The version of XCode that shipped on the Tiger installation
  DVD will not work if you plan to use a newer version of Python
  downloaded from python.org.  XCode 2.4.1, may be downloaded from
  http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode .

- X11.  This is available on the Tiger installation DVD.  You should
  also use Software Update to update X11 to the latest version.

Standard Build and Install
``````````````````````````

Download and install the unofficial wxPython-Gtk-X11 distribution from
the Gamera Files section on SourceForge.

  Alternatively, you can install fink and then build the package
  wxPython-Py23, which is currently in the unstable branch, (and its
  dependencies) from source.  You will then need to use the fink
  version of Python (not the one that Apple provides) to carry out the
  instructions below.

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.

To build Gamera, open a X11 terminal and type::

  python setup.py build

and then to install (you'll need to have admin privileges)::

  sudo python setup.py install

The scripts can be installed by::

  sudo python setup.py install_scripts -d /usr/bin

.. note:: The ``-d /usr/bin/`` installs the scripts in a reasonable
  place on the PATH.  If you do not specify it, the scripts are by
  default installed to
  ``/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/bin``.

Installing without root privileges
``````````````````````````````````

The instructions for `installing without root (administrator)
priviledges`__ can also be used on Mac OS-X.

__ without_root_

Running
```````

Start an X11 terminal and run the ``gamera_gui`` script.

.. note:: Running the script from the root of the source tree will not
  work, since it will not be able to find the compiled version of
  Gamera.
